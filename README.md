# Project: YIN & SOUND IN THE SOUTH

 [View this website on GitHub Pages](https://kescardoso.github.io/MS1-yinsoundsouth/)

My first milestone project for Code Institute is a prototype for a real product: A static landing page for our Yin-Yoga and Sound Healing Training Immersion in the South of France. Besides being a student at Code Institute and future Software Developer and UX Extraordinaire, I have been a Yoga Teacher and Sound Therapist for the past 5 years here in France.

That means that this project has educational and  entrepreneurial goals (this Yoga and Sound Immersion is actually a real service being developed by me and my teacher partner). For this project development I will be applying my web development and marketing communications skills to create a fully functioning responsive website, which will present the program and sell registrations online.

Thanks for appreciating this project with me :)

## My UX Process

### 1. Who is our target client (avatar)

#### This website is targeted to:
- Qualified and aspiring yoga teachers, wishing to improve their skills and teach Yin Yoga with Sound Healing in their communities;
- Students and practitioners of yoga, fitness or alternative healing modalities wishing to develop a deeper understanding of Yin Yoga and Sound Healing for their own personal or vocational purposes;
- Regular clients who love yoga and are looking for a wellness retreat or short experience-based vacation in nature.

#### Our demographic is (from larger scope to main avatar):
- French and International clients (mostly from: Europe and USA) between 25-55 years old;
- English-speaking expats living in the South of France (Nice, Antibes, Cannes, Monaco, Menton and surrounding areas, as well as Paris);
- Our current yoga students and clients from Nice and surrounding area interested in going deep into their practice (already introduced to our business);

#### Our Client Avatar:
- Our main client-avatar is: females between 30-45 years old living in the south of France and who are interested in: yoga, alternative medicines, hiking, outdoor activities, vegetarian and organic food, ecological affairs, career change, holistic and health habits, and mainstream spirituality.

### 2. What is our client looking to achieve

This client is looking for information online on how to get trained or improve their Yin Yoga skills. They are looking for either a formal training or an immersion experience that leads to qualifications for teaching Yin Yoga with Sound Healing support (these two modalities are often used together and lead to combined training). Clients desire to experience an immersion fast-track, retreat-like program that functions as both intensive training and/or short vacation. Budget and proximity is an important element, and they usually can’t afford or don’t wish to invest in flagship trainings from Yoga Alliance, for example. 

They need a well explained presentation, in form of an online webpage, that lays out all the important details on how / where / when they can achieve their goals and what they will get as a result if they sign up to our program. They also expect to have easy access to registration and online payment options, as well as easy contact to inquire about the program if they are unsure or need assistance making a decision.

### 3. How this project will help clients achieve their goals

- This website is completely responsive; it has been carefully optimized and tested for all devices: mobile, tablet and desktop.
- This website is a user-friendly, one scrolling page with a top-fixed navbar, presenting wide space with text, images, videos and grids to help and guide clients into finding the information they are looking for.

#### User Stories:
A female English-speaking expat in the South of France, who relocated with her husband and needs to redefine her career and social life. She is looking to quickly integrate the job marketing by becoming a yoga instructor among expats moms in her small town community with a short and budget-friendly training.

- I want to know upcoming dates and price options for this local training, and so I click on the PRICE & DATES item on the menu bar to automatically scroll down the page and see a table with 4 different price packages and a second box with the upcoming training dates in this page-section.

- I want to know details about the precise location where this local training is held, and so I click on the LOCATION item on the menu bar to automatically scroll down the page and see descriptions, photos and video in this page-section showcasing the retreat center.

- I want to know details about the training schedule, and so I click on the SCHEDULE item on the menu bar to automatically scroll down the page and see the page-section with 5 column-grid showing the schedule from Wednesday(Day1) to Sunday(Day5).

- I want to know details about the training program and the learning outcomes, and so I click on the PROGRAM item on the menu bar to automatically scroll down the page and see a description of the philosophy behind the training, to whom it is for and what I will learn if Ì take the training.

- I want to get to know the teachers in this training, and so I click on the MENTORS item on the menu to automatically scroll down the page and see their bio and profile photo.

- I am ready to enroll in this local training, and so I click on the ENROLL / CONTACT button on the menu bar, or the REGISTER NOW button on the hero image, to automatically scroll down the page and find the registration form.

- I want to inquire about enrollment in this training, and so I click on the ENROLL / CONTACT button on the menu bar, or the REGISTER NOW button on the hero image, to automatically scroll down the page and find the INQUIRE NOW button to get in touch with the staff.

- I am very interested in the training while I get to the bottom of the page into the registration section, but I am not yet ready to enroll, and so I click on the NEWSLETTER button to sign up to receive future news via email related to this training.

### 4. Wireframe

- [Link to my Wireframe on Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/SBGSRVoWq5737gajqHsn5VjN/YT?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=min-zoom)
	- This was my first wire-framing experience and it was very positive. It took me sometime and frustration to learn how to use Figma, but once I understood it, wire-framing became a must. After finishing my wire-framed mockup website, I felt very good about going into development because I knew exactly the appearance I wanted to achieve with Bootstrap. I made some adjustments as I developed the webpage, but wire-framing definitely made the development phase a lot easier and fun!
