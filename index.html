                    <p>Our 50 Hour Yin Yoga & Sound Healing Training Immersion  is a gentle, integrative and practical course that creates a sacred space where time expands and slows down, allowing you to find your deepest sense of self. This approach combines a unique blend of yin poses, sacred sounds, meditation through movement and stillness, experiential anatomy, principles of Chinese medicine, breath work, and mind-body ritual practices.</p>

                    <p>We know that the way we care for ourselves, others, and the environment is interrelated. This is why it is so important for us that our training is held in nature — through open windy spaces, in valleys, mountain tops and rivers — so you can immerse in yourself and find your own loving guidance within. In this training you will dive deep in holistic well-being where the richness and subtleties of life are deeply experienced. As you follow your journey through the art of yoga and sound, we will help you cultivate the skills of practicing and guiding: you will learn to transmit from your own grace and power, while you develop your skills and potential as a yogi and as a teacher.</p>
